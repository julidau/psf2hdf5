# psf2hdf5
A simple PSF waveform data to HDF5 converter

For now just an experiement to test, whether...

1. The HDF5 format can be usefull
2. The HDF5 format is comparable to pdf storage-wise
3. a potientiel converter can be performant

This program is so trivial, that i am not even sure a release is useful, but maybe it can be extended.
